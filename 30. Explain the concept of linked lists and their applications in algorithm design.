A linked list is a linear data structure where each element, called a node, contains:

Data: The value stored in the node.

Next: A reference to the next node in the sequence.

Types of linked lists:

Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.

Doubly Linked List: Each node points to both the next and previous nodes.

Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node.

Applications in Algorithm Design:
Dynamic Memory Allocation: Linked lists grow and shrink dynamically, unlike arrays, which have a fixed size.

Stacks and Queues: Linked lists are used to efficiently implement these data structures for algorithms like DFS (stack) and BFS (queue).

Polynomial Representation: Linked lists are used to represent polynomials where each node stores a coefficient and exponent.

Sparse Matrices: Efficiently stores non-zero elements of a matrix, saving memory.

Undo Operations: Many applications, like text editors, use linked lists to implement undo functionality.

Graph Representation: Used in adjacency lists to represent graphs.

Circular Lists: Used in round-robin scheduling or music players where the list loops back to the start.

Linked lists offer efficient memory usage and allow fast insertions and deletions but have slower access times compared to arrays. They are useful in dynamic and memory-intensive applications.
