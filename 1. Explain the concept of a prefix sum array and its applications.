A prefix sum array is a data structure where each element stores the sum of all preceding elements in the original array, up to that index. Here's a concise breakdown:

Concept:
Given an array arr, a prefix sum array prefixSum is created.
prefixSum[i] holds the sum of arr[0] to arr[i].
Applications:
Range sum queries: Efficiently calculating the sum of elements within any subarray.
Image processing: Used in integral image calculations.
Dynamic programming: it is used as a sub routine in many dynamic programming solutions.
Algorithmic problem solving: used to optimize solutions for various problems that involve subarray sums.
